"Due to lack of time, I could not fully test the GET API in the demo video. However:" 
"- You can pass multiple query parameters in the API." 
"- You can filter jobs using query parameters like **location**, **tags**, and **job_type**." 
"- Sorting is also available based on **date**, by passing \`posting_date_desc\` as the sort value."
